I cannot be a master of everything, but I can be a Jack of all trades. But this is not helping me anymore. I need to be a master of one or two topics and be “good enough” at several others to make myself a complete package.<!--readmore-->

I have a PhD in engineering, but I love talking, marketing, selling stuff. How do I combine all of these into one awesome product? I need a strong foundation for sure. For example, WhatsApp! It is a great messaging product that is actually very bare-bones. It only does messaging (text + media). What I think sets it apart is solid engineering (it has never crashed on me, or failed even once) and extremely clean design. It has strong fundamentals and no fluff.

When I think about industry giants, they are solidly grounded in some aspect (either engineering, marketing, economics) and then use that as a base to branch out to other fields — and conquer them. I need my true North that I can turn to whenever I want to. Something I can solidly rely upon.

I am (like most people I know), in the tech industry - albeit in a very specialized and niche corner. A fast-moving and vitally important corner. But I find myself drawn to different avenues on a daily basis - mobile development, dynamic visualization, advertising, financial programming and when I look back at everything that I have done in the past 5 years, I realize that I am unfortunately a Jack of several trades and nowhere close to being a master of one. Almost blindly I have avoided looking at my boss’s career trajectory - he was a solid programmer out of school and built upon it and sharpened his knife every single day and now heads an R&D group across 4 countries. He picked up managerial skills along the way, but his true North is his ability to direct any software architectural issue that crops up.

Building a foundation translates to decluttering my focus. I took a long deep look at what subjects I enjoyed studying, at what inspired me during my PhD, what dictated the final shape of my thesis, what’s kept me ticking at work all these years and I came up with a list of 3 skills I need to have and several other nice-to-haves that make me more rounded.
