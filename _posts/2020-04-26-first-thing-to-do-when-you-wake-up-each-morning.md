Today being Sunday, I had a bit of time on my hands and I decided to re-think how my I spend my time and come up with a plan of action for the month of May (coming up soon ‚Äì right?).

I looked back at the last couple of months and things seem to be a blur. <!--readmore-->

With the Corona virus causing havoc throughout the world, people out of work, stranded in foreign lands, no sense of livelihood, don‚Äôt know how or where the next pay-check is going to come from, I realized that we are at a turning point in our lives.

**A fork in the road as they say.**

Turn left and continue living your life like you always did. All what‚Äôs going on is a one-large illusion and it never happened. Once the government eases the lockdown, I am going to go back to my old life.

Or, you turn right, and turn a new leaf.

Learn from whats happening around you. Learn from the mistakes you made in your past. Learn from the lockdown and how you lived on bare necessities. Observe, Take notes, Critique, and Learn. Use this tragedy and forge a new life and a new path for yourself. You will never (hopefully) get to see something like this again and you have the potential to go where you have never dared to before.

As I planned my days and weeks, I realized one thing. A strange realization, but it dawned upon me that I can plan and execute everything only if I am alive.

> Observe, Take notes, Critique, and Learn. Use this tragedy and forge a new life and a new path for yourself.

Is the concept of ‚Äúbeing alive‚Äù and not dead something we take for granted?

There are 100s of people dying around the world from pain and suffering inflicted by war, conflicts, disease, disaster ‚Äì each and every second of the day.

That got me thinking and I came to this realization that I want to share with you. I am going to do this each day ‚Äì first thing when I wake up.

Here goes ‚Äì

> When I wake up each morning, the first thing that I am going to do is smile and say ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù!

I am going to give a big, big, big smile and mentally congratulate myself for having woken up.

I am going to smile and count my blessings that I am not one of the 100s of people who passed away in their sleep.

I am going to smile and remind myself that today I get to hug my wife and my kids because I did not die in my sleep.

I am going to smile and remind myself that today I get to stand outside, breathe the fresh air, feel the warmth of the sun on my face, and hear the birds chirp. Because I did not die in my sleep.

I am going to smile and remind myself that today I get to talk to my friends and family, share my feelings, love them, pray to God, meditate, do my job, eat my meals, and lead my life because I did not die in my sleep.

**And, when I am ready to go to bed, I am going to smile and thank God for giving me the chance to live another day.**

With gratitude in my heart, I am going to sleep and hope that I wake up the next morning.

Stay loved and stay blessed!

Bye and hope to see you tomorrow üòâ
