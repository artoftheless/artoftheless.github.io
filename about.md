“Art of the Less” is my online journal where I chronicle my efforts at making myself a better person — little-by-little, every single day. I am by no means a master, or a Guru, or a pundit. I am just a 30-something y/o trying to lead a simple, deliberate, clutter-free, focused life and giving myself the best shot at happiness!

“Simple living and high thinking” is a saying that I’ve heard since I was a little kid, but it has taken me a long time to understand and internalize. Years of living on my own, moving across continents, meeting people of various cultures and backgrounds, battling with problems, etc. have helped me appreciate the beauty in leading a simple, deliberate, and conscious life.

I’ve decided to chronicle all the thoughts and realizations that have emerged out of my continual experimentation in artoftheless.com and I welcome you to join me in this wonderful journey.

Lastly, like many others, I have been able to see far only because I have stood on the shoulders of many others who have tread this path before I have. My gratitude goes out to the fantastic teachings in the Bhagavad Gita, the writings of Robin Sharma, Marcus Aurelius, Jaggi Vasudev, Stephen Covey, and many others whose names you’ll find in my blog posts.

If you have some tips to share, or you’d like to point me to some resources, or simply say hi, please use the contact form and I’ll get back to you within 24 hrs.

Thank you!
